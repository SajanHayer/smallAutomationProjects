# smallAutomationProjects
A repository of small little automation projects that I have created. Each file has the ability to be built upon for more advanced uses. 

spinCircle.py -> This python files allows the user to move a red a circle a random number of movments between the white circles on the screen in a clockwise movement. 

animateImage.py -> This python file allows the user to create a file given to the program pixel by pixel a quicker version of the autoPaint.py file which was the 
orginal. 

autoPaint.py -> This python file draws an image provided on MS paint. It auto changes colours and draws a HD (1280 x 780) sized image in ~4 hours on MS paint.
